# focus timer
this is the timer for focus and stuff to stop scrolling and be productive or whatever

how to get it on chrome:
1. download the files from here: 1. click "Code" green button, download zip, unzip it.
2. open chrome and type chrome://extensions in the bar at top 
3. look at the top right for developer mode toggle and turn it on
4. click the load unpacked button that shows up
5. pick the folder called Focus (make sure its the Focus folder not "Focus ...", inside of it should be the files so select that folder)
6. it should show up now so just pin it to your bar and lock in

that is all really hope you like it :)
